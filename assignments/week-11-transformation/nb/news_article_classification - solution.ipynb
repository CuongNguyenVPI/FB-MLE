        "* Multihead attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on different positions of the input sequence at different time steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Multi-head attention works by splitting the embedding vector into multiple heads. Each head is then used to compute the attention score. The attention score is then concatenated and passed through a linear layer to get the final output. The number of heads is a hyperparameter that can be tuned. The intuition behind using multiple heads is that each head can learn different aspects of the input.\n",

        "* Positional encoding is a technique used to add information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence to the embedding vector. This is important because the model needs some way of understanding the order of the words in the input, just like humans do. The positional encoding is added to the embedding vector. The positional encoding vector that is added to the embedding vector has the same dimension as the embedding vector.\n",
